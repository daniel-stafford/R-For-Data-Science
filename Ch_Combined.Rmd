compact <- mpg |> filter(class == "compact")

# Left
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point()

# right
ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point()
```
Share scales across multiple plots


```{r}
x_scale <- scale_x_continuous(limits = range(mpg$displ))
y_scale <- scale_y_continuous(limits = range(mpg$hwy))
col_scale <- scale_color_discrete(limits = unique(mpg$drv))

# Left
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale

# Right
ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale


# In this particular case, you could have simply used faceting, but this technique is useful more generally, if for instance, you want to spread plots over multiple pages of a report.
```

11.4.6 Exercises
Why doesn’t the following code override the default scale?

Ones needs to use `scale_fill_gradient` instead of `scale_color_gradient`
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = rnorm(10000)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "blue") +
  coord_fixed()

```

What is the first argument to every scale? How does it compare to labs()?

The firs argument is name, which is the name of the scale. It is similar to labs() in that it is used to set the name of the scale, but it is used to set the name of the scale, not the name of the axis or legend.

Change the display of the presidential terms by:

```{r}
presidential |>
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = start, y = id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_x_date(name = NULL, breaks = presidential$start, date_labels = "'%y")

prez + 
```


Combining the two variants that customize colors and x axis breaks.

Improving the display of the y axis.

Labelling each term with the name of the president.

Adding informative plot labels.

Placing breaks every 4 years (this is trickier than it seems!).

First, create the following plot. Then, modify the code using override.aes to make the legend easier to see.

TBD

```{r}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut), alpha = 1/20)

12.2.4 Exercises

How does dplyr::near() work? Type near to see the source code. Is sqrt(2)^2 near 2?

Uses built in tolerance to compare two numbers

```{r}
near(sqrt(2)^2, 2)
```

Use mutate(), is.na(), and count() together to describe how the missing values in dep_time, sched_dep_time and dep_delay are connected.

```{r}
missing_flights <- nycflights13::flights |> 
  mutate(
    dep_time_miss = is.na(dep_time),
    sched_dep_time_miss = is.na(sched_dep_time),
    dep_delay_miss = is.na(dep_delay)
  )

count(x = missing_flights, dep_time_miss, sched_dep_time_miss, dep_delay_miss) 
```
If departure time is missing, departure delay is also logically missing.

Multiple filters
```{r}
flights |> 
  filter(month %in% c(1,12))
```

12.3.4 Exercises
Find all flights where arr_delay is missing but dep_delay is not.

```{r}
flights |> filter(is.na(arr_delay) & !is.na(dep_delay))
```


Find all flights where neither arr_time nor sched_arr_time are missing, but arr_delay is.

```{r}
flights |> filter(!is.na(arr_time) & !is.na(sched_arr_time) & is.na(arr_delay))
```

How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing in these rows? What might these rows represent?

```{r}
missing_dep_time <- flights |> filter(is.na(dep_time))

# make this rows instead of columns, 1st col missing category, 2nd col count of missing
other_missing_counts <- missing_dep_time %>%
  summarize(across(-dep_time, ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "category", values_to = "count_of_missing") %>%
  arrange(desc(count_of_missing))
```

Assuming that a missing dep_time implies that a flight is cancelled, look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is there a connection between the proportion of cancelled flights and the average delay of non-cancelled flights?

```{r}
cancel_timeline <- flights |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-"))) |> 
  group_by(year, month, day) |> 
  summarize(
    date = first(date),
    cancelled = sum(is.na(dep_time)),
    avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    prop_cancelled = cancelled / n() 
  ) %>%
  ungroup() |> 
  select(-year, -month, -day) |> 
  distinct()

cancel_timeline |> ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cancelled)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Percentage of flights canceled",
    title = "Cancelled flights over time"
  )

cancel_timeline |>
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_delay, y = prop_cancelled)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # make percentage
  labs(
    x = "Average delay of non-cancelled flights",
    y = "Proprtion of cancelled flights",
    title = " Proprtion of Cancelled flights and average delay"
  ) 

```

Generally speaking, the more delays of non-canceled flights, the more likely there are cancelations.

## 12.5.4 Exercises

A number is even if it’s divisible by two, which in R you can find out with x %% 2 == 0. Use this fact and if_else() to determine whether each number between 0 and 20 is even or odd.

```{r}
x <- 0:20
y <- if_else(x %% 2 == 0, "even", "odd")
```

Given a vector of days like x <- c("Monday", "Saturday", "Wednesday"), use an if_else() statement to label them as weekends or weekdays.

```{r}
# make vector of Monday to Sunday
days <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
y <- if_else(days %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
```

Use if_else() to compute the absolute value of a numeric vector called x.

```{r}
x <- c(-1, 0, 1)
y <- if_else(x < 0, -x, x)
```

Write a case_when() statement that uses the month and day columns from flights to label a selection of important US holidays (e.g., New Years Day, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). First create a logical column that is either TRUE or FALSE, and then create a character column that either gives the name of the holiday or is NA.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
flights_holidays <- flights |>
  mutate(
    holiday =
      case_when(
        month == 12 & day == 25 ~ "Christmas",
        month == 12 & day == 31 ~ "New Years",
        month == 7 & day == 4 ~ "4th of July",
        month == 10 & day == 31 ~ "Halloween",
        TRUE ~ NA
      )
  ) |>
  mutate(
    is_holiday =
      case_when(
        month == 12 & day == 25 ~ T,
        month == 12 & day == 31 ~ T,
        month == 7 & day == 4 ~ T,
        month == 10 & day == 31 ~ T,
        TRUE ~ F
      )
  )
```

13.3.1 Exercises
How can you use count() to count the number rows with a missing value for a given variable?
```{r}
flights |> 
  filter(is.na(tailnum)) |> 
  count()
```
Expand the following calls to count() to instead use group_by(), summarize(), and arrange():

```{r}
flights |> count(dest, sort = TRUE)

flights |> group_by(dest) |> 
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


```{r}
flights |> count(tailnum, wt = distance)

flights |> group_by(tailnum) |> 
  summarise(
    n = sum(distance)
  )
```

13.4 Numeric transformations

What will sum(is.na(x)) tell you? How about mean(is.na(x))?

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 6)
sum(is.na(x)) # number of missing values
mean(is.na(x)) # proportion of missing values 1 / 3 

```


What does prod() return when applied to a logical vector? What logical summary function is it equivalent to? What does min() return when applied to a logical vector? What logical summary function is it equivalent to? Read the documentation and perform a few experiments.

13.4.8 Exercises

Explain in words what each line of the code used to generate Figure 13.1 does.

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100) |>  
  # group by hour, extrat bour 1345 -> 13
  summarize(prop_cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_time)), n = n()) |>
  # percnatge of missing dep_times as well as count per hours
  filter(hour > 1) |>
  # only flight after 1am (00 is is all missing?)
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = prop_cancelled)) +
  # plot hoour vs. percentage canceled
  geom_line(color = "grey50") + 
  # conct the dots
  geom_point(aes(size = n))
  # make plots bigger if more flights at that time
```

What trigonometric functions does R provide? Guess some names and look up the documentation. Do they use degrees or radians?

sin(x), cos(x) etc. in radians

Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. You can see the basic problem by running the code below: there’s a gap between each hour.

```{r}
flights |> 
  filter(month == 1, day == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

Convert them to a more truthful representation of time (either fractional hours or minutes since midnight).

```{r}
get_minutes_since_midnight <- function(time) {
  hours <- floor(time / 100)  # Extract the whole number part (hours)
  minutes <- time %% 100  # Extract the remainder (minutes)
  minutes_since_midnight <- hours * 60 + minutes  # Convert hours to minutes and add minutes
  return(minutes_since_midnight)  # Return the result
}

flights_midnight <- flights |> mutate(
  dep_time_midnight = get_minutes_since_midnight(dep_time),
  sched_dep_time_midnight = get_minutes_since_midnight(sched_dep_time)
)

flights_midnight |> 
  filter(month == 1, day == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time_midnight, y = dep_time_midnight)) +
  geom_point()
```


Round dep_time and arr_time to the nearest five minutes.

```{r}

round_to_nearest_5_minutes <- function(time) {
  hours <- time %/% 100  # Extract the hours
  minutes <- time %% 100  # Extract the minutes
  # Round the minutes to the nearest five-minute interval
  rounded_minutes <- round(minutes / 5) * 5
  # Adjust hours and minutes if rounding leads to 60 minutes
  if (rounded_minutes == 60) {
    hours <- hours + 1
    rounded_minutes <- 0
  }
  # Combine hours and rounded minutes to form the rounded time
  rounded_time <- hours * 100 + rounded_minutes
  return(rounded_time)  # Return the rounded time
}

# Example usage:
time <- 859  # Example time in HHMM format
rounded_time <- round_to_nearest_5_minutes(time)
print(rounded_time)  # Print the rounded time
```

13.5.4 Exercises
Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().

```{r}

What does flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number() < 4) do? What does flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number(dep_delay) < 4) do?

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  filter(row_number() < 4) # keep on first three flights per destination
```

```{r}
flights |>
  group_by(dest) |> 
  filter(row_number(dep_delay) < 4) |> view()
# keep first three flights with smallest departure delay per destination 
```

For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

```{r}

flights |> glimpse()
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarize(
    total_delay = sum(arr_delay, na.rm = T)
  )

flights |> 
  mutate(
    prop_delay = (dep_delay + arr_delay) / air_time, .before = year
  )
```

Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag(), explore how the average flight delay for an hour is related to the average delay for the previous hour.

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(hour) |> 
  summarize(
    avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  mutate(diff = avg_delay - lag(avg_delay, default = NA)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=diff, y=avg_delay)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  mutate(hour = dep_time %/% 100) |> 
  group_by(year, month, day, hour) |> 
  summarize(
    dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |> 
  filter(n > 5)
```

Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error)? Compute the air time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  filter(row_number() < 5)
  arrange(air_time) |> ungroup() |> relocate(air_time) |>  print(n=100)
  
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  filter(row_number(air_time) < 2) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  relocate(air_time, dep_time, arr_time, dest) |> 
  view()
 
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  mutate(
    # get the short flight for each destination
    shortest_flight = min(air_time, na.rm = T)
  ) |> ungroup() |> 
  mutate(
    # compare each flight to the shortest flight of the destination
    relative_shortest = air_time / shortest_flight
  ) |> view()
  
```


Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use those destinations to come up with a relative ranking of the carriers based on their performance for the same destination.

```{r}
two_carriers  <- flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  mutate(num_carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) |> 
  filter(num_carriers > 1) 
   
  
```
